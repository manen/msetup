# msetup

manen's sort of useless setup utility

## why

it creates a license, readme, and editorconfig.
saves you like 4 clicks

## installation

requirements: git, [v](https://vlang.io)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/manen/msetup
cd msetup
v . -prod -o out
sudo ./out symlink
```

you're done!

## usage

whenever you're in a brand new directory, just run `msetup` and you're good to go.
